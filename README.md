# sqlalchemy_challenge

For this project, I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database found in the Resources folder. Specifically, I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize the data exploration. 

In addition, I created a Flask API based on the queries made in the previous jupyter notebook file. Some of the routes included: a homepage, information on precipitation, information on temperature, a list of the stations that monitored the weather, and a route that would present temperature data based on user-inputted dates.
